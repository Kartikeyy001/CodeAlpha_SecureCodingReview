# CodeAlpha_SecureCodingReview
This project is part of the CodeAlpha Cyber Security Internship Task 3: Secure Coding Review. A Python-based login system was reviewed to identify security flaws such as hardcoded credentials and plaintext passwords. Secure coding techniques like password hashing were applied to improve authentication and enhance overall application security.
